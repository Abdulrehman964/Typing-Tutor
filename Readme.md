<br>
Welcome to the Typing Tutor project! This project is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy, providing them with an advantage in competitive programming and other typing-related tasks. Unlike online typing tutors, our Typing Tutor works offline, ensuring accessibility for all users.
<br>
#Project Description
The Typing Tutor allows users to practice typing exercises to enhance their typing skills. By matching each typed letter with the corresponding letter in the exercise text, users can track their accuracy, words per minute (WPM), and overall score.

Why Typing Tutor?
The decision to create the Typing Tutor stemmed from the observation that many individuals prepare for coding competitions by improving their typing speed online. However, access to online resources isn't always guaranteed. Thus, our team aimed to create an offline typing tutor to address this issue.

Problems Analysis
To develop the Typing Tutor, our team analyzed the process of matching typed letters with the exercise text. We focused on accurately determining incorrect entries to calculate accuracy and devised methods to store and retrieve user data efficiently.

Methodology
The methodology employed in this project involves:

Matching typed letters with the exercise text using loops.
Calculating accuracy, WPM, and score based on user input.
Storing exercise data in files for future reference.
Displaying exercise text by reading from files.
Implementation
In our implementation, we utilize conditional statements to differentiate between correct and incorrect entries. Incorrect entries are highlighted in red, while correct entries are displayed in green. The formulas used for calculating WPM, accuracy, and score are as follows:

WPM = (60 * words) / time
Accuracy = ((Total no. of letters - no. of wrong letters) / total no. of letters) * 100
Score = (accuracy * 10) + (WPM * 2)
Results
The Typing Tutor provides users with a platform to enhance their typing speed and accuracy efficiently. With regular practice, users can track their progress and observe improvements over time.

Conclusions
Developing the Typing Tutor allowed our team to gain insights into dynamic thinking and the utilization of various header files, such as windows.h and dos.h. This project sparked our interest in exploring different header files and motivated us to continue enhancing the Typing Tutor in the future.
